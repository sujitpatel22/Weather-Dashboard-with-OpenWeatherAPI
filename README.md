# Weather-Dashboard-with-OpenWeatherAPI

# Overview

The Weather Trends Application allows users to fetch and display weather data for major cities around the world. Users can search for specific cities, view current weather conditions, and see trends over time. The application is built using Django for the backend and Vue.js for the frontend.

# Features

- **Fetch Weather Data**: Automatically fetches weather data for predefined major cities.
- **Search Functionality**: Users can search for any major city and view its current weather, even if it is not in the predefined list.
- **Dynamic Data Storage**: New city data can be added to the database if the searched city is not already present.
- **User-Friendly Interface**: An aesthetic and responsive design for easy navigation and data visualization.
- **Real-time Updates**: Weather data is refreshed at regular intervals.

# Technologies Used
